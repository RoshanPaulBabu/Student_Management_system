## Set Up Email Backend

Open the `settings.py` file located in the `student_management_system` directory and configure the email backend settings as follows:

    ```python
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'
    ```

    Replace `'your_email@gmail.com'` and `'your_email_password'` with your Gmail email address and password, respectively. Make sure to enable less secure apps access for your Gmail account if you're using Gmail as the email backend.
